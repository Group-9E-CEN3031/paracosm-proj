### Before you start working

You want to make sure you have the most up-to-date version of the project and any changes you make will not cause merge conflicts.

```
git pull <alias> <branch_name>
```

### After you are done working

```
git status (will show you the files you changed)
git add <insert the filenames here>
git commit -m <insert message here>
git push <alias> <branch_name>
```

### Information about branches

```
git status (will show the current branch you are working on)
git branch <branch_name> (create a new branch with that name)
git checkout <branch_name> (moves to a different branch)
```
