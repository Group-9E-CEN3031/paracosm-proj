### Before you start working

You want to make sure you have the most up-to-date version of the project and any changes you make will not cause merge conflicts.

```
git pull <alias> <branch_name>
```

### After you are done working

```
git status (will show you the files you changed)
git add <insert the filenames here>
git commit -m <insert message here>
git push <alias> <branch_name>
```

### Information about branches

```
git status (will show the current branch you are working on)
git branch <branch_name> (create a new branch with that name)
git checkout <branch_name> (moves to a different branch)
```

### In case of merging branches

We will review each others work, and make sure nothing breaks before implementing the changes, and the scrum master will have the last review, trying to catch anything.
